# Share Some Sadness

Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.

Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is! 

The word 'happiness' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.
